## Object-Oriented Programming vs Functional Programming

[Relevant Link](https://www.codenewbie.org/blogs/object-oriented-programming-vs-functional-programming)

OOP - brings data and behaviour to one location: the object

FP - data and behaviour should be separate for clarity

- does not create objects, just modifies data sets
- output commands are designed by programmer too because it's a transformation of the data
- tracks state and history due to transformation of data (original data is not altered, we are handed a transformed copy of original data)
