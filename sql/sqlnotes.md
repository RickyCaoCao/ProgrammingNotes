# SQL Notes

### Primary and Foreign Keys

Foreign key is a field that points to primary key in another table
 - Primary Key Constraint - will make sure the row will have a unique id
   - if two columns are both unique id, then indexes can be duplicated but the combination of both columns must be unique

 foreign key constraint prevents destroying links between tables

#### SQL has no arrays in columns???
